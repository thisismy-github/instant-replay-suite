Add .WAV files with the appropriate filename and they will be
played automatically when their associated action occurs.

Actions:
concatenating files (concatenate.wav)
deleting files (delete.wav)
trimming files (<number of seconds>.wav -> 15.wav, 30.wav, etc.)

---

The default files are sourced from https://ttsmp3.com/ with
the "US English/Joanna" voice and converted to .WAV using
PyPlayer (alternatively: https://cloudconvert.com/mp3-to-wav).
